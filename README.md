# Social media app created for my needs to master usage of API calls, react hooks, and building CSR AND SSR websites.

## Technologies I used to build this app: TypeScript, SCSS, NextJs, ReactJS, Bootstrap, Kinde Auth, Prisma.

### To get started with this web app you need to create account on kinde.com, and then get environment variables to set up the app on your .env.local file, then run these commands:
### `npm i`
### `npm run dev`
